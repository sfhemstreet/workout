        Working out can get boring when you repeat your same workouts over and
        over again. I know, I did the same routine for years. I didn't want to
        read click-bait ads disguised as articles trying to find a new workouts.
        So I created Workout, a place where we can all share workout routines
        and build them for free without getting force feed marketing.
